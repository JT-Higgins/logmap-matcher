# LogMap: An Ontology Alignment and Alignment Repair System

**News:**

1. LogMap is now relying on the [OWL API 4](https://github.com/owlcs/owlapi/wiki/Migrate-from-version-3.4-and-3.5-to-4.0). See here the (non-maintained) branch that uses [OWL API 3](https://github.com/ernestojimenezruiz/logmap-matcher/tree/logmap-owlapi-3)
2. Check out the new material about the division of the ontology alignment task [here](#division-of-the-ontology-alignment-task).

## About

LogMap is a highly scalable ontology matching system with ‘built-in’ reasoning and inconsistency repair capabilities. LogMap extract mappings between classes, properties and instances.

To the best of our knowledge, LogMap is one of the few matching systems that:

1. can efficiently match semantically rich ontologies containing tens (and even hundreds) of thousands of classes,

2. incorporates sophisticated reasoning and repair techniques to minimise the number of logical inconsistencies, and 

3. provides support for user intervention during the matching process (see [Web interface](http://krrwebtools.cs.ox.ac.uk/logmap/)). 

Please refer to the [OAIE campaign](http://oaei.ontologymatching.org/) for official results about LogMap.


## Downloading and Development

LogMap standalone distributions and OAEI packages can be downloaded from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/logmap-matcher/).  

Development requires a clone of this git repository. You can use the pre-configured Eclipse (Maven) project. Dependencies are automatically downloaded with the exception of google translate which needs to be manually added to the maven local repository (see [lib/readme_mvn_install_google_translate.txt](./lib/readme_mvn_install_google_translate.txt)).
 
To generate a JAR file for LogMap from the command line using Maven, run: `mvn package` or `mvn clean install`. This will also generate a folder *java-dependencies* with all the necessary libraries. This folder together with the *parameters.txt* file should be placed in the same path as the generated "logmap-matcher-3.0.jar" file. 




## Using LogMap

LogMap accepts the same ontology formats as the OWL API: e.g., RDF/XML, OWL/XML, OWL Functional, OBO, KRSS, and Turtle (n3).

**As an Ontology Matching System**

LogMap can be used from the command line with the [standalone distribution](https://sourceforge.net/projects/logmap-matcher/files/Standalone%20distribution/) or 
the [OAEI packages](https://sourceforge.net/projects/logmap-matcher/files/OAEI%20packages/), or directly from its [Web interface](http://krrwebtools.cs.ox.ac.uk/logmap/)

It has recently been implemented support to be run in the [HOBBIT platform](https://project-hobbit.eu/outcomes/hobbit-platform/). See details [here](https://gitlab.com/ernesto.jimenez.ruiz/logmap-hobbit).

LogMap can also be easily integrated in other Java applications. See [wiki](https://code.google.com/archive/p/logmap-matcher/wikis) for additional information.


**As a Mapping Debugging System**

LogMap can also be used as a mapping debugging system from the command line or integrated in a Java application. See [wiki](https://code.google.com/archive/p/logmap-matcher/wikis) for additional information.

We have also implemented a variant of LogMap to minimize the violations of the conservativity principle. Check details [here](https://github.com/ernestojimenezruiz/logmap-conservativity).


## Division of the Ontology Alignment Task

LogMap also includes a novel module to divide the ontology alignment task into manageable subtasks.
